# Mosaic Motif - Mosaic Browsing

Hi there. This is an attempt to create a visual representation for the **Mosaic Browsing** problem from the ICPC. For the problem statement - [45th ICPC World Finals - Problem G - PDF page 13](https://icpc.global/worldfinals/problems/icpc2021.pdf)

## Demo video

[video demo](mosaic-browsing.mp4)

## Info

I have used Python to create a GUI with PySimpleGUI library and a naive approach to solving the Mosaic Browsing problem (yeah, general nested looping - bad $O(n^2)$ time complexity, for a better approach, refer to the official solution video on YouTube that use a Fast Fourier Transform and String Pattern Matching techniques). The main idea here is to make a GUI to visually look at the matches.

## Codeview

**Language Used**: üêç Python

**Libraries Used**:

* **PySimpleGUI** - For creating windows, buttons, input fields and other GUI elements
* **OpenCV** - For drawing images of mosaic and motif, highlighting regions

## Instructions

To run the application, you will need a Python Interpreter. Then, install the necessary dependencies (pysimplegui, opencv-python, numpy) and run the gui.py file from the root directory of the project, "Mosaic Motif" or "Mosaic Motif Colourful" directories to see the applications.
